We have updated the Bases formula syntax and the file format to make formulas and filters more expressive and powerful.</p>\n<p>If you use Obsidian on multiple devices, we recommend upgrading all devices at the same time to avoid issues syncing base files with different syntax.</p>\n<h3>The new formula syntax</h3>\n<p>The new formula syntax is more flexible, easier to use, and better suited to extensibility. For those familiar with Javascript, the new syntax should feel familiar. New functions and types are described in <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/bases/functions\">our docs</a>.</p>\n<p>Some highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functions are now object-oriented. Instead of <code>contains(file.name, &quot;Books&quot;)</code>, the formula would be <code>file.name.contains(&quot;Books&quot;)</code>.</li>\n<li>Functions can now be chained. e.g. <code>property.split(' ').sort()[0].lower()</code></li>\n<li>Property names are no longer wrapped in backticks (`). Instead, to reference properties with spaces or special characters, the syntax is <code>note[&quot;Property Name&quot;]</code></li>\n<li>There is a new type system which provides greater control when writing formulas.</li>\n<li>New functions, such as <code>link</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>list</code> for converting a value to a different type.</li>\n<li>New file properties: <code>file.path</code>, <code>file.links</code> (a list of all internal links in this file), and <code>file.tags</code> (a list of all tags in this file, including frontmatter).</li>\n<li>Some functions have been replaced by comparison operators. For example, <code>dateBefore(date1, date2)</code> is now <code>date1 &lt; date2</code>.</li>\n<li>Date modifications are now much simpler. Instead of <code>dateModify(date, string)</code>, you can use <code>date + string</code>, for example, <code>date(&quot;01/01/2025&quot;) + &quot;1 year&quot;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For help migrating existing Bases to the new syntax, take a look at the <a href=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-migration-quick-start-guide/101571\">migration guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>File format changes</h3>\n<p>The Bases (<code>.base</code>) file format has been updated for greater extensibility. There is a new <code>properties</code> section for all property configurations, such as <code>displayName</code>.

By default, results are now sorted alphabetically. And more recently used commands will rank higher in the search results.</li>\n<li>Editing a file no longer resets folded sections in the Outline view.</li>\n<li>Canvas cards now support callouts without generating internal errors.</li>\n<li>Pressing <code>Shift-Enter</code> inside a text property no longer creates an empty input.</li>\n<li>Cursor placement is now accurate when navigating table cells after searching.</li>\n<li>When using the &quot;Obsidian frame&quot; window frame style, the Window title will now properly update to show the currently open file in pop-out windows.</li>\n<li>List numbering remains consistent when editing inside callouts.</li>\n<li>PDF view no longer steals focus when opened in the background.</li>\n<li>Strict line breaks now render properly in the first paragraph of a callout.</li>\n<li>Outline view now highlights the correct line when the note includes footnotes.</li>\n<li>Markdown tables containing partially complete HTML now render correctly.</li>\n<li>Tab history buttons, Web viewer history entries, bookmarked URLs, and ribbon items that open notes now respect modifier keys and honor the &quot;Focus new tab&quot; preference.</li>\n<li>Canvas now consistently copies selected notes when pressing <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</li>\n<li>The Tags view now updates correctly when clearing the search filter.</li>\n<li>Autocompleting a codeblock now properly accounts for indentation and if the cursor is inside a list item.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS properties added to <code>document.body</code> are now mirrored across all pop-out windows.</li>\n<li><code>ButtonComponent</code> now automatically shows a loading spinner if the <code>onClick</code> event is async.</li>\n<li>You can now bypass the Web viewer and specify that a URL is opened in the user's default browser using <code>window.open(url, '_external')</code>.</li>\n<li><code>idb</code> has been updated to version 8.0.2.</li>\n<li><code>yaml</code> has been updated to version 2.7.0.</li>\n<li>YAML aliasing has been disabled to prevent unintended references when assigning the same object to multiple keys.</li>\n<li>Assigning the same object to multiple keys via <code>processFrontmatter</code> will no longer create a YAML alias.</li>\n</ul>\n","major_release":false},{"version":{"major":1,"minor":8,"patch":10,"pre_release":null},"platform":"Mobile","insider":false,"date":{"year":2025,"month":4,"day":22},"info":"<p>Includes all new functionality and bug fixes up to <a href=\"/changelog/2025-04-22-desktop-v1.8.10/\">Obsidian Desktop v1.8.10</a>.</p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On Android, it is now possible to use the app without giving the &quot;All files&quot; permission, however when doing so you can only store vaults inside the app storage.</li>\n<li>A small banner requesting feedback may appear at the top of settings.
