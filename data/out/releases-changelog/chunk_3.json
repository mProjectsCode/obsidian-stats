You can now resize multiple cards at once by dragging from the selection box. You can also <em>nudge</em> selected cards in any direction by pressing the arrow keys.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/220686409-b09002a7-ba40-42df-a76e-79d513bd8526.gif\" alt=\"resize-multiple-cards\"></p>\n<h3>Readonly mode</h3>\n<p>Once you have your cards arranged exactly how you like them, you can use the new <strong>readonly mode</strong> to lock your canvas content in place. While in readonly mode, a canvas and its contents cannot be modified.</p>\n<h3>Canvas settings</h3>\n<p>There is now a settings page for Canvas with the following configuration options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default location for new canvas files.</li>\n<li>Use scroll wheel zoom instead of pan.</li>\n<li>Options to hide the card labels.</li>\n<li>Global setting for &quot;snap to grid&quot; and &quot;snap to objects.&quot;</li>\n<li>Configurable zoom threshold for when cards switch from showing their content to just showing the card title.</li>\n<li>Configurable behavior of <code>Ctrl/Command + Drag</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Global search support</h3>\n<p>Content from text cards will now appear as search results in the global search view.</p>\n<h3>Background images for Canvas groups</h3>\n<p>Canvas groups can now have a background image associated with them. With a group selected, press the new &quot;set background&quot; button and choose an image from your vault.</p>\n<p>The image can be set to cover the entire group or be used as a repeating pattern.</p>\n<h3>Jump to group</h3>\n<p>The new &quot;Jump to group&quot; command allows you to search for groups in your open Canvas by name. Selecting a group will quickly pan the viewport to that group.\nSome other notable improvements to Canvas:</p>\n<h3>Narrow to block</h3>\n<p>Similarly to the &quot;Narrow to heading...&quot; feature, there is now a &quot;narrow to block&quot; menu item for file cards in the Canvas. Just right-click on a file card and choose &quot;Narrow to block...&quot; to see a list of all blocks in the given file. Selecting a block from the list will change the card to only display the contents of that block.</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleting a file now closes its tab if there are other tabs in the tab group.</li>\n<li>Obsidian Sync's settings page will now warn you if your vault is in Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive. Using multiple sync providers can lead to data conflicts.</li>\n<li>&quot;Follow link under cursor&quot; commands will now create a new canvas file if the linked canvas (i.e. <code>[[dashboard.canvas]]</code>) doesn't exist.
