We've found that tabs provide a more intuitive experience for both browsing and editing notes in your vault.</p>\n<p>Tabs have had us rethinking some of the most basic interactions with Obsidian. We have taken this opportunity to consolidate the hotkeys for opening files. Combine these modifier keys when clicking on any link in Obsidian (this includes the quick switcher!) or use them with <kbd>Enter</kdb> to navigate the link under the cursor.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>MacOS</th>\n<th>Windows/Linux</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Navigate</strong></td>\n<td><em>None</em></td>\n<td><em>None</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>New Tab</strong></td>\n<td><kbd>‚åò</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)</td>\n<td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>New Tab Group</strong></td>\n<td><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd></td>\n<td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>New Window</strong></td>\n<td><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>\n<td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Tabs have also inspired some changes to how users browse their vaults. It felt only natural that we also introduce <strong>per-tab history</strong>. Each tab now maintains its own history for navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/191052493-8109f1a1-411c-4b61-b435-788d0cac3231.png\" alt=\"per-tab history\"></p>\n<h2>Tab stacks</h2>\n<p>You can now switch any tab group in your workspace into a <em>tab stack</em>.

Try mixing and matching with a tab group on one side and a tab stack on the other.</p>\n<h2>New appearance settings</h2>\n<p>We've introduced quite a few new settings at <strong>Settings ‚Üí Appearance</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Show inline title</strong></td>\n<td>Notes now display the full note title inline with the note contents as an <em>Inline Title</em>.

The window title is hidden. In settings, you can choose between the new frameless mode, the custom Obsidian frame (old default), and using the native OS window frame.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Accent color</strong></td>\n<td>There's now an &quot;accent color&quot; color-picker to give your vault its own unique style.
