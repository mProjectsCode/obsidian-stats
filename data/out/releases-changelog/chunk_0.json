We have updated the Bases formula syntax and the file format to make formulas and filters more expressive and powerful.</p>\n<p>If you use Obsidian on multiple devices, we recommend upgrading all devices at the same time to avoid issues syncing base files with different syntax.</p>\n<h3>The new formula syntax</h3>\n<p>The new formula syntax is more flexible, easier to use, and better suited to extensibility. For those familiar with Javascript, the new syntax should feel familiar. New functions and types are described in <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/bases/functions\">our docs</a>.</p>\n<p>Some highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Functions are now object-oriented. Instead of <code>contains(file.name, &quot;Books&quot;)</code>, the formula would be <code>file.name.contains(&quot;Books&quot;)</code>.</li>\n<li>Functions can now be chained. e.g. <code>property.split(' ').sort()[0].lower()</code></li>\n<li>Property names are no longer wrapped in backticks (`). Instead, to reference properties with spaces or special characters, the syntax is <code>note[&quot;Property Name&quot;]</code></li>\n<li>There is a new type system which provides greater control when writing formulas.</li>\n<li>New functions, such as <code>link</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>list</code> for converting a value to a different type.</li>\n<li>New file properties: <code>file.path</code>, <code>file.links</code> (a list of all internal links in this file), and <code>file.tags</code> (a list of all tags in this file, including frontmatter).</li>\n<li>Some functions have been replaced by comparison operators. For example, <code>dateBefore(date1, date2)</code> is now <code>date1 &lt; date2</code>.</li>\n<li>Date modifications are now much simpler. Instead of <code>dateModify(date, string)</code>, you can use <code>date + string</code>, for example, <code>date(&quot;01/01/2025&quot;) + &quot;1 year&quot;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For help migrating existing Bases to the new syntax, take a look at the <a href=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-migration-quick-start-guide/101571\">migration guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>File format changes</h3>\n<p>The Bases (<code>.base</code>) file format has been updated for greater extensibility. There is a new <code>properties</code> section for all property configurations, such as <code>displayName</code>.
