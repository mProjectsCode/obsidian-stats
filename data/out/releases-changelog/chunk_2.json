The core plugins Search, Templates, and Backlinks have all received upgrades to support Properties. Some of the new features in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new UI for editing properties, with autocomplete for property names and values</li>\n<li>Properties can have types (e.g. text, list, date, number, checkbox) that make it faster to input data</li>\n<li>Properties can contain internal links to other notes</li>\n<li>New sidebar view lists all properties in your vault, and sort by name or frequency</li>\n<li>Keyboard navigation, commands, and hotkeys</li>\n<li>Search syntax for searching notes by property and value</li>\n<li>Templates automatically merge properties with existing properties in the note</li>\n<li>Data is still stored as YAML frontmatter at the top of each Markdown file. Metadata is automatically formatted as valid YAML.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this update you can also enable two-factor authentication for your Obsidian account.</p>\n<h2>Properties</h2>\n<img alt=\"Property Editor\" src=\"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/assets/693981/aea72173-5663-459d-83de-6ff888f6bdd5\">\n<p>Properties help you organize information about a note. Adding properties to a note helps you track structured data such as text, links, dates and numbers. Properties can also be used in combination with Community plugins that can do useful things with your structured data. <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties\">Learn more.</a></p>\n<h3>Basic usage</h3>\n<p>To add a property to a note, you have several options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <strong>Add file property</strong> command.</li>\n<li>Use the <strong><code>Cmd/Ctrl+;</code></strong> hotkey.</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>Add file property</strong> from the <strong>More actions</strong> menu (three dots icon) or right-clicking the tab.</li>\n<li>Type <code>---</code> at the very beginning of a file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you add a property, a row will appear at the top of the file with two inputs: the property <em>name</em> and the property <em>value</em>. Once you choose the property name you can give it a value and type.</p>\n<h3>Advanced usage</h3>\n<p>In addition to the inline property editor, there is a new <strong>Properties view</strong> core plugin that adds two new views for managing your properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All properties</strong> sidebar view shows a list of all the properties across your vault, and number of uses for each. Click on a property to search for all uses of it across your vault.</li>\n<li><strong>File properties</strong>  sidebar view shows the properties for the active file. If you prefer to hide the inline property editor, you can choose to edit your file properties from the sidebar, without losing your place in the active file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Properties are an extremely powerful yet flexible feature that gives you even more ways to organize your information. See the <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties\">documentation for Properties</a> for even more information.</p>\n<h2>Two-factor authentication (2FA) for Obsidian accounts</h2>\n<p>For even more security, you can now enable two-factor authentication on your Obsidian account. To do so, go to <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/account\">obsidian.md/account</a> and enable &quot;2-factor authentication&quot;. This will prompt you with setup instructions.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> Any devices logging into Obsidian must be running v1.4.5+ to log-in using two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h2>Core plugin upgrades</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Search: New <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Search+properties\">search syntax</a> for properties.\n<ul>\n<li>To find notes containing a property, use [<em>property</em>]</li>\n<li>To find notes with a property and a corresponding value, use [<em>property</em>:<em>value</em>]</li>\n<li>Both property and value allow complex sub-queries, such as parentheses for grouping, the OR operator, double-quotes for exact matching, and regex.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Templates: When using the &quot;Insert template&quot; command, properties inside template files will be merged with the current file.</li>\n<li>Backlinks: Properties with links will now properly show in backlink entries.</li>\n<li>Note Composer: Merging notes will now merge their properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Misc. improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Search: Search autocomplete will now be shown based on the current input context.</li>\n<li>Live Preview now supports single column tables.</li>\n<li>Tag autocomplete now uses a fuzzy search algorithm.</li>\n<li>PDF: Added “Copy as quote” and “Copy annotation” context menu options</li>\n<li>PDF: Added a button to copy annotations from the annotation popup</li>\n<li>PDF: Added “Copy link to page” to PDF thumbnail context menu</li>\n<li>Editor: Formatting commands for <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, etc are now context-aware.
