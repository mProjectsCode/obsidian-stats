The following table shows the number of patches per minor version.
This does not include insider releases.

## Lifetimes of Versions

The following graph shows how long each version was the latest (most recent release),
a higher bar indicates that the version was the latest release for a longer period of time.
Each bar is colored either blue to indicate that it is <i>public</i> release, or red if it represents an <i>insider</i> release.

This chart, instead, only shows the time it took between each public release, ignoring all insider releases.

<ReleasesTimeBetweenPublic />

Finally, in this chart, only the minor version (i.e. "0.2", "1.2", etc.) is considered, and the time between each minor version is calculated.
The red color indicates how long the minor version was the latest available version, or in other words, how long it took for the next minor version to be released.
The blue color indicates how many days it took for the next minor version to be released after the last patch.

## Release Changelog Size

The following graph shows the amount of changes for every release, split by category.
This statistic is determined by simply counting the number of items in the changelog.
Keep in mind that this is not a definitive indicator of the actual 'substantiveness' of a release,
and major (X.Y) releases usually re-list changes from previous insider releases.
